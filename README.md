### Note:
This mod includes a hardcoded maximum step height of 2 blocks, which may be controversial for some users. The reason for it being 2 blocks currently, is to give a decent customizable range. Although, intentionally, this mod is required on a server for it to work on a server so that it doesn't act as a 'cheat'.
